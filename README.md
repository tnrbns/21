# CMSC 21 - Fundamentals of Programming

Laboratory activities I've done for CMSC 21 for second semester, SY 2021-2022.

## List of laboratory activities:
1. *Day of the week* - user inputs date `YYYY MM DD` and program calculates what day it falls on (Sunday, Monday, etc.) and its ordinal date (350th day of the year)

2. *Recursion* - division, primality checks and integer checks via recursion

3. *Tic-tac-toe* - implement a tic-tac-toe game using 2D arrays

4. *Object counting* - given an $n\times m$ grid, program counts the number of objects (taking into account its 8-connected neighbors) and prints the resulting value

5. *Sorting* - given integer $n$, followed by a number of $n$ integers, program sorts the integers in ascending order

6. *Snakes and ladders* - implement the snakes and ladders game

7.  *Fractions* - using `fraction` structure, do some arithmetic and fraction simplification

8. *Strings* - concatenate and slice strings using vectors

9. *Student information system* - a student information system using linked lists

10. *Zodiac signs* - user inputs date `YYYY MM DD` and receives a fortune. Fortunes are retrieved from `data.for` while dates are appended in `data.in`. User must not receive the same fortune.
